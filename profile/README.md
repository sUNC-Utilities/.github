**sUNC** stands for **senS' Unified Naming Convention**. It is a tool designed to check if an executor can properly run essential global functions, following the existing [Unified Naming Convention](https://github.com/unified-naming-convention/NamingStandard/tree/main).

Unlike the original UNC (which is now outdated and prone to spoofing), sUNC ensures that functions actually work as intended, by testing them as if they were to be used in a real scenario.
However, we are not in any way calling UNC "bad". We are simply stating that people should not be using UNC to deeply test their environment, as it was never intended to do so.

This organisation aims to publish the open-source aspects of sUNC so that people can collaborate and contribute to things like the sUNC documentation.
